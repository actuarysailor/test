### Description

Manage all Github repo settings from a YAML file, enabling greater change control, transparency, and auditability.
<!-- action-docs-description source="action.yml" -->

## Usage

Manage Administrative Repository Settings from within a repository - via a YAML file!

**Why would you want to do this?**
* Adhere to principal of least-privilegas for developers and other contributors.
  * *Allows contributors without repo admin privileges to propose admin changes for review by repo owners and maintainers*
* Enables contributors without admin rights ability to maintain variables, secrets, deployment environments, etc.
  * *GitHub restricts many of these items to the repo admin role, but granting this role to many people runs in direct conflict to requirements by audit teams, generally accepted best practices for governance, or corporate standards and requirements*
* Ability to centralize maintenance of repo configurations and permission standards
  * *Use of [.github repo](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/) or some other centralized repo*
    * Make directories containing standardized example workflows and use the file-copy to maintain all CI/CD workflows matching a given regex pattern for repo names
    * Similary, add a settings.yml file to that directory to standardize variables, secrets, access control lists, etc.

**What Items You May Manage:**

* repos *configure external repos*
* repo settings
* branch protection(s)
* labels
* secrets
* variables
* deployment environments
* contributors *e.g. access control lists or ACL management*
* files *such as CI/CD, codeowners, issue and pull-request templates, etc.*

See [examples/settings.yml](./examples/settings.yml) for an example config file. The schemas for this file are in [repo_manager.schemas](./repo_magager/schemas).

### File Management -- Experimental

File management can copy files from your local environment to a target repo, copy files from one location to another in the target repo, move files in the target repo, and delete files in the target repo.

File operations are performed using the Github BLOB API and your PAT. Each file operation is a separate commit.

This feature is helpful to keep workflows or settings file in sync from a central repo to many repos.

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Run Repo Manager
on: [workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  repo-manager:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.6

    - name: Run RepoManager
      # you should always reference a version tag to ensure that your use of an action never changes until you update it
      uses: actuarysailor/gha-repo-manager@v2.0.0
      with:
        # Apply your settings to the repo, can also be check to just check repo settings vs your file or validate, to validate your
        # file is valid
        action: apply
        settings_file: .github/settings.yml
        # need a PAT that can edit repo settings
        # note, some settings may require additional permissions; see comments in examples/settings.yml for details
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}

```
